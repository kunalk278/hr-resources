<h1 id="timesheets">Timesheets</h1>
<p>Time tracking in Harvest is rather straightforward - simply record your time under the project that your work relates to. Time spent on company-specific work should go under the general Admin project. You may use the timer feature built-in to Harvest, or record time as you go in 15 or 30 minute increments. Please record time daily. Timesheets will be closed at the end of each week.</p>
<p>There are currently projects for every action from our Executive Plan, as well as additional projects for locality-specific work. For instance, if you are working on updates to a core product, such as bug fixes for Madison, you’d record this under the Madison-core project. However, if you’re working on marketing materials for Madison for the House, you’d want to put this time under Madison - House instead.</p>
<p>Tasks break down as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design - Any time actually producing or giving feedback on designs.</li>
<li>Development - Programming only for new development.</li>
<li>Bug Fixes - Programming only when it's fixing things that are broken. (These two are broken out as we'll bill them differently if we have paying clients. Also it's good to know where our time goes.) For non software developers, editing is bug fixing.</li>
<li>Writing - Blog entries, proposal drafts, and documentation</li>
<li>Project Management - Communication with current localities, vendors, and contractors.</li>
<li>Business Development - Communication with new potential board members, partners, localities, etc.</li>
<li>Admin - Any day-to-day stuff that doesn't fit the other categories.</li>
<li>Vacation/Sick - only available on the Internal project. Even if we don't officially keep track of this, we want to have ballpark numbers to work with.</li>
</ul>
